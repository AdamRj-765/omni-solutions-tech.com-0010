			<strong>Key Strengths &#38; Skills:</strong><br>
			With an academic background in Computer Science and twelve years of hands-on experience running an Information Technology (IT) small-business, I am a seasoned IT Professional and Front-End Engineer who has a formal education in x86 Native Coding, Object-Oriented Programming, and Front-End Web Development. When Omni-Solutions Tech was a startup, it afforded me the opportunity to master business skills on top of handling contracted technology projects which brought me years of detail-oriented experience as an entrepreneur. And, as it grew to service clients in need of Systems Integration, Consulting, Services Management, Web Operations(WebOps), Security As A Service (SaaS), Custom Web Application Design & Development, and Data Governance, I also gained many years of experience in administration and troubleshooting Bare-metal Systems and VPS and Cloud Hosting Solutions running UNIX/Linux Server and Windows Server 2019 and Azure Cloud.
			<br>
			My experience with Omni-Solutions put me in a unique position to see many aspects of technology in today's business models from the standpoint of a Support Specialist, a UI Designer and Developer, an Office Manager, a Digital Marketeer, a Bookkeeper, a Chief Technology Officer, and a CEO. Many of the projects I secured entailed writing proposals and estimates, negotiating contracts, employing and leading teams of developers and staff, and consulting with stakeholders for designing and developing new or better Custom Business Content Websites, E-Commerce, custom payment gateways, and quality business content for CMS platforms such as WordPress and others. My position also afforded me the lead of development for projects that included design and development of WordPress custom themes, custom website UX design and W3C compliant HTML5 development designed for SEO, and which also generated a proficiency of Database Administration, System Administration of Enterprise Network Topologies, and MS Domain Controlled environments.
			<br>
			I have found that in modern business, growth makes one acutely aware of what moves a company’s services and product to the market, be it sales through a digital footprint and digital marketing, demographic research, avenues of customer satisfaction, the latest knowledge of systems integrations, or automation and innovations such as Artificial Intelligence. My dedication to understanding how networked computer systems continue to play a vital role in today's business model has provided me with a well rounded level of experience and sound knowledge of modern technologies and their vital roles in it’s infrastructure, and how “thought leadership” provides a more productive collaborative workflow to generate greater value in a company’s products.
			<br>
			I am also an exceptional public speaker as well as an author of correspondence, proposals, technical knowledge base documentation, walk-throughs, whitepapers, and technical manuals. And I am happy to teach others the knowledge I have in live training, on stage, in conference, or on video in order to generate results for teamwork, complete understanding, and a mission completion every time and to build better user-friendly, business efficient, and quality technology for the business goals of the future.

			<strong>Summary of Qualifications:</strong> I started this journey learning Applesoft BASIC on an Apple IIe thirty-eight years ago when I wrote my own version of a text-based adventure game and since then, I have continued to expand my knowledge and expertise of technology which I carry to every assignment I am lucky enough to be handed. The experience I have amassed over time is one of my biggest assets, but it wouldn’t be useful if I weren’t as driven as I am to continue to contribute to the  growing age of digital information. It is this information that makes me a valuable player in this industry, and the challenges of knowing how it works is my greatest tool for making those contributions. As in earlier days, I feel I have strong system administration, development, data governance and technical support skills from those years of growth, and my ability to express and teach those skills to others completes the journey. I will always contribute and continue to learn when I can about how to build better user-friendly, business efficient, and quality technology infrastructures within the business goals that I find.

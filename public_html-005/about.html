					<h1 class="page-title">Who Founded Us?</h1>
					<p>Omni-Solutions Technology Consultants was founded in 2015 by an ex-Symantec Enterprise Product Support Analyst, Adam Rodriguez.</p>

					<p class="dark"> After experiencing many viral outbreaks and Microsoft compatibility issues with some Symantec Enterprise products, Adam headed his team in finding several product issues such as several security gaps in various Symantec Enterprise Products, and some installation and configuration issues that needed further product testing and documentation. His introduction of using SSL/TLS security for communication between the Symantec Enterprise Edition's Management Console and Symantec Client Edition's network communications for added security brought about a new level of security to the internal workings of the product. He also broke new department productivity records by personally consulting Symantec paying clients with over fourty-seven inbound technical support calls on average per day over a two year period at one of the highest call volume periods the company experienced.</p>

					<p> After reaching a Level 2 support role, Adam decided to take his experience to a more lucrative means of providing his talent to the general public. His skill set had grown to many aspects of troubleshooting the Microsoft Operating Systems of both pro client and server editions.</p>

					<p class="dark"> Hid continued his career by starting a small-business called Omni-Solutions Technology Consultants (a.k.a. Omni-Solutions Tech), where he could provide support to lower income users such as regular consumers as well as other small-businesses, and  continuing to support enterprise clients. His new company would bring technical support to the forefront of user support and experience with the newest support tools to ensure customer satisfaction on all levels of information technology.</p>

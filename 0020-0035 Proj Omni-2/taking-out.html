        <p"I'm getting incredible (and very patient) assistance in creating a web site for my business. Since I have all the photos and writing for it, the "Omni-Solutions Technican" has shown me how to put it into the format. (over the phone!) I'm an artist, not a "geek", so combined, we're continuing to create a fantastic web site for my business. I feel like I have a "partner" in this endeavor, not someone who gets frustrated with my lack of computer ability. I highly recommend this consultant firm to help anyone, even if you don't understand computer inner workings. My technician is also very adapt on Photoshop, so he can work with artists very efficiently."</p>
